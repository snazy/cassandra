  Apache Cassandra specific
  =========================

  Project properties:
    -PtestRerun                --> rerun tests, even if the inputs (sources for example) did not change
    -PtestRepetitions=N        --> run test tasks N times
    -Pcodecoverage             --> enable codecoverage (jacoco)
    -Prelease                  --> add some build-related information to the jar manifest
    -Ptest.runners=N           --> use exactly N parallel test forks and don't rely on automatic calculation
                                   based on memory & CPU.
    -PwithSigning              --> Sign generated archives

  Calculation of the test parallel forks:
  - If the test task explicitly demands single execution (e.g. testDistribution task via noParallelTests=true),
    use exactly one fork.
  - If the test.runners property is specified, use that value
  - Use the maximum(1, minimum(number-of-processors / 1.75, installed-memory / 4G)).
    - number-of-processors defaults to java.lang.management.OperatingSystemMXBean.getAvailableProcessors
      override with -Pcores.count=N
    - installed-memory defaults to com.sun.management.OperatingSystemMXBean.getTotalPhysicalMemorySize
      override with -Pmem.size=N (in bytes)

  Other (project) properties:
  - Signing build artifacts:
        To sign build artifacts, you must specify the -PwithSigning option to ./gradlew (or have withSigning= in
        your ~/.gradle/gradle.properties). Other options that affect signing are described in
        https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/signing_plugin.html#sec:using_gpg_agent - most importantly:
        signing.gnupg.executable=gpg and signing.gnupg.keyName=<your-gpg-key-id>
  - Publishing to Sonatype:
        Either add -PsonatypeUsername=username and -PsonatypePassword=password to each invocation of ./gradlew or
        add entries for sonatypeUsername=username and sonatypePassword=password to your ~/.gradle/gradleproperties


  ant migration help
  ==================

  To run tests:
    ./gradlew test --tests <test-pattern>
  where test-pattern can be just a class name, a fully qualified classname, some wildcard expression, anything actually

  Common tasks:
    ./gradlew jar
    ./gradlew dist
    ./gradlew distTar


  IDE help
  ========

  Don't run the "idea" task. Instead, just open the project in IDEA.
